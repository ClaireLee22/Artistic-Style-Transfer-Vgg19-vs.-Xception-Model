### Project Procedure

### Project Results

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

This project requires **Python 3.6** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip)

(Optional) If you are using AWS, use python 3.6 on AWS EC2 instance p2.xlarge which has tensorflow and GPU support.
- It has 4 vCPUs with 61GB RAM. We recommend machines of at least this configuration to run our program in reasonable time - for 2000 documents and top 500 words in each document the run took ~4 hours.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, run one of the following commands:

```bash
python Doc2Doc_comparison.py
```
